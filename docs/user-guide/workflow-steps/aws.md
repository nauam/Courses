# Amazon Web Services - Workflow Steps

## Getting Started

[Amazon's EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) (Elastic Cloud Compute) is a cloud service in wide use for dynamic infrastructure; it is easy to start up and shut down Node "Instances" in the cloud.  Use these QW Control steps to automate common EC2 actions.

**Access Key ID**
: Specify your AWS Access key.

**Secret Key**
: Specify your AWS Secret Key

**Region**
: Specify the region for the node.  If using the EC2 Node Source it's possible to use `${node.region}` and the region will be dynamically populated with the region for that node.

## EC2 VM Workflow Steps (Enterprise Only)

For most of these steps an **Instance ID** will need to be included for the instance to be acted on.

### AWS / VM / Start

Start the EC2 instance.

### AWS / VM / Stop

Start the EC2 instance.

### AWS / VM / Delete

Terminate the EC2 instance.

 Be very careful when using this step.  It would be possible to remove a lot of instances by mistake if the node filter is too broad.
