## Overview
### Job Scheduling Improvements
Scheduled business tasks are essential to internal processes that keep the business running (Financial operations, inventory operations, fulfillment requests, etc.) Scheduled operations tasks are essential to keeping infrastructure running (rotating logs, cleaning up temp files, restarting known faulty services, validating configuration and security settings/conditions, etc.). Unknowingly missing either is a business continuity issue. Also unknowingly missing a run and then running again can cause bigger problems (data corruption, bad configuration, runaway processes, etc)

In this release we have included an early access version of our Missed Schedules feature as part of our Enterprise Scheduling package. Scheduled job executions that are not started within a configurable tolerance window will be marked as "Missed".  Use Job Notifications to then trigger an email or integration action to follow-up.  More details on configuration can be [found here.](/manual/schedules/missedjobfires.md).

The Remote Execution Policy feature was originally meant for "run now" job executions. It was later enabled for Jobs at scheduling time. However this only changes the schedule ownership to a different cluster member *at scheduling time*.  With the introduction of Enhanced Scheduling that policy no longer fit the bill.  We have updated the Remote Execution Policy to evaluate load at the *time of execution* and selects the appropriate cluster member.
