# Configuring Plugins

## Overview

Most of what Rundeck does is via one of its plugins.
Several [plugin types](/administration/configuration/plugins/plugin-types.md) exist
to [execute commands on nodes](/administration/configuration/plugins/configuring.md#node-execution),
perform a step in a workflow,
send a notification about job status, gather
[information about the hosts](/administration/configuration/plugins/configuring.md#resource-model-sources)
in your network, copy a file to a remote
server, store and stream logs, or talk to a user directory.

See the [Plugin Developer Guide](/developer/index.md) if you are interested in creating one of your own plugins.
