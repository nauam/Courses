# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure - VM Node Source

[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) is a cloud service in wide use for dynamic infrastructure; it is easy to start up and shut down Node "Instances" in the cloud.


## Configuration

To configure Authentication use this page as a reference: [Create Credential for OCI Authentication](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/management-cloud/logcs/create-credentials-oci-authentication.html)

**Tenant ID**
: The OCID of the tenant.

This setting can be configured using _System Configuration_ using `oracle.tenant_id` or project specific using `project.oracle.tenant_id`

**User ID**
: The OCID of the user.

This setting can be configured using _System Configuration_ using `oracle.user_id` or project specific using `project.oracle.user_id`

**Fingerprint**
: The fingerprint for the RSA key pair that you're using to access OCI. It looks something like this: `12:34:56:78:90:ab:cd:ef:12:34:56:78:90:ab:cd:ef`.

This setting can be configured using _System Configuration_ using `oracle.fingerprint` or project specific using `project.oracle.fingerprint`

**Private Key Path**
: The private key in the RSA key pair should be stored in the Rundeck Key Storage. The RSA key pair is generated from OCI in PEM format (minimum 2048 bits).  This "path" is the path to the key in Key Storage.  Example: `keys/project/oracle-test/connection.pem`

**Region**
: Specify the region for the node.  If using the OCI Node Source it's possible to use `${node.region}` and the region will be dynamically populated with the region for that node.

**Compartment ID**
: If VMs are organized into compartments use this setting here to specify the proper Compartment.  (If there are no compartments in use, set this to the same value as Tenant ID)

## Filtering Nodes

**Just running instances**
: Will return only running instances to populate the Node listing.

**Defined Tag Name for custom Attributes**
: <TBD>
