# Rundeck Enterprise Licensing

## Overview

While Rundeck is an open source project maintained by Rundeck Inc, Rundeck Enterprise is commercial software for which you can purchase a license from Rundeck Inc. Rundeck Enterprise provides a tested, supported, and enterprise-ready distribution of Rundeck with additional features and capabilities for enterprise scale use. Also, a Rundeck Enterprise subscription license is the only way to receive professional support from Rundeck and the core Rundeck team.

Rundeck Enterprise is available under an annual subscription license and comes bundled with support. You can renew the right to use the software and receive access to support on an annual basis. Multi-year subscription purchases can also be made.

Rundeck Enterprise is licensed per a combination of Rundeck Enterprise clusters (consisting of two servers), any additional servers, and the number of users using Rundeck Enterprise. There are no restrictions on the number of projects, nodes, or jobs run.

No software with GPL or other “copyleft” licenses are used in Rundeck Enterprise. All license rights for using Rundeck Enterprise are contained within the single Rundeck Enterprise license.

Rundeck Inc. guarantees that Rundeck Enterprise does not infringe on any patents, copyrights or misappropriates any trade secrets. Rundeck will defend licensees against such claims. For details, see [Rundeck Enterprise Master Software License Agreement](http://support.rundeck.com/customer/portal/articles/2723878-rundeckpro-license).

## License Key Installation

Ask for the license key to the support team. Then install the license key via the gui or on the filesystem directly.

### Via filesystem

Copy the license file to the correct directory depending of the kind of installation.

License file name : `rundeckpro-license.key` ( don't change to a different name )

File location:

Rundeck package RPM (Redhat/centos) or DEB (debian/ubuntu):

```
/etc/rundeck/
```

Rundeck Launcher:

```
$RDECK_BASE/etc/
```

Rundeck + Tomcat:

```
$RDECK_BASE/etc/
```

### Store license in database

If you would like to store your license in your database rather than your filesystem, turn on the following setting:

`rundeck.license.useStorageTree=true`

If you have a license file installed in your Rundeck server it will be migrated automatically into the database.

When Rundeck boots it will check the license file on the filesystem if it exists, and if the issue date of
that license is more recent than the license in the database, the database will be updated with the license
on the filesystem.

### Store the license using a custom storage tree

If you would like to store your license in a storage tree, you can configure a storage tree using the standard
storage tree config options.  

Turn on license storage tree usage then provide your configuration using the prefix: `rundeck.license.storage`

Example storing the license in Amazon S3

```
rundeck.license.useStorageTree=true
rundeck.license.storage.provider.1.type=object
rundeck.license.storage.provider.1.path=/
rundeck.license.storage.provider.1.config.bucket=rundeck
rundeck.license.storage.provider.1.config.objectStoreUrl=https://s3.amazonaws.com
rundeck.license.storage.provider.1.config.accessKey=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
rundeck.license.storage.provider.1.config.secretKey=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```
