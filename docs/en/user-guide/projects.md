# Projects

A _project_ is a place to separate management activity.
All QW Control activities occur within the context of a project.
Multiple projects can be maintained on the same QW Control server.
Projects are independent from one another, so you can use them to
organize unrelated systems within a single QW Control
installation. This can be useful for managing different teams, infrastructures,
environments or applications.

Projects can be [archived](/en/administration/projects/project-archive.md) and imported to other QW Control servers to help
promote changes between environments.

A new installation will not contain any projects so QW Control will present
you with a dialog to create one.

[Documentation for managing projects can be found here.](/en/administration/projects/)
