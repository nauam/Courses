# QW Control Introduction

## What is QW Control?

QW Control is runbook automation that gives you and your colleagues self-service access to the processes and tools they need to get their job done.

When used for incident management, QW Control will help you have shorter incidents and fewer escalations.

When used for general operations work, QW Control will help alleviate the time-consuming and repetitive toil that currently consumes too much of your team's time.

For more information on use cases, see the [New to QW Control] page.

With QW Control, it is simple and easy to create workflows (called "jobs") from any of your existing tools or scripts. Trigger QW Control jobs from the Web GUI, API, CLI, or by schedule. QW Control's access control features make it easy to safely delegate control of tasks to those traditionally outside of operations.

QW Control was designed to accept the reality that heterogeneous infrastructure and tooling are a fact of life in any sizable organization. That is why QW Control doesn't make you replace the scripts, commands, or tools you use today. You use QW Control to execute workflows across your existing automation (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, legacy tools, and all of your custom scripts/APIs) or quickly automate previously manual procedures. With QW Control you can reuse the automation skills you already have and add new ones as needed.

Out of the box, QW Control gives you capabilities that would be expensive to develop and maintain in-house: workflow control, scheduling, error-handling, logging, access control, option passing, log filtering, web GUI, REST API (with CLI tools) and integration with external sources for authentication, resource model, and option data.
