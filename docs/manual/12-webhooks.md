# Webhooks

## Webhooks
Webhooks are an industry standard way for internet applications to communicate with each other.  Rundeck Webhooks are an entry point to automation with Rundeck.  A Webhook can be configured to accept incoming payloads and trigger Rundeck Job(s).  Webhook events are handled by [Webhook Event](/developer/16-webhook-plugins.md) Rundeck plugins.


## Webhook Administration

Click on `Webhooks` to go to the webhook administration page to add, configure, and remove webhooks for a project.

The [Webhook API](/api/rundeck-api.md#webhooks-beta) or using the rd cli tool can also manage webhooks.

### Webhook Handlers

Webhook Event Handlers are custom handlers that can be developed as [Rundeck Plugins](/developer/16-webhook-plugins.md) to interact with external systems.
They can respond to authentication calls, pre-process inputs, and provide configuration defaults for specific systems.

Rundeck includes the following Webhook Handlers:

* [Advanced Run Job (Enterprise)](./webhooks/advanced-run-job.md)
* [PagerDuty Run Job (Enterprise)](./webhooks/pagerduty-run-job.md)
* [DataDog Run Job  (Enterprise)](./webhooks/datadog-run-job.md)
* [AWS SNS (Enterprise)](./webhooks/aws-sns-webhook.md)
* [GitHub (Enterprise)](./webhooks/github-webhook.md)
* [Run Job](./webhooks/run-job.md)
* [Log Events](./webhooks/log-events.md)


For a full tutorial on creating a Webhook follow our [How To Use Webhooks](/learning/howto/using-webhooks.md) guide.

### Webhook Tips

:::warning
Please note that after the webhook has been created, it is not possible to change the `Webhook User`. This field will become read only.
:::

:::tip
When configuring a user on a Webhook ensure that the user has logged into Rundeck at least once.  If the user has never logged in to Rundeck before a validation error will occur
saying that the user cannot be found. Once that users logs in one time it is possible to specify the user in the webhook form.

### Webhook Debugging

>_“Why didn’t my webhook do X?!”_

Rundeck Enterprise includes a Webhook Debugger integrated with the Webhook builder. The Debugger makes troubleshooting incoming webhooks and why they did (or did not) trigger certain rules in the Advanced Rule Processing Handlers.

Alternatively, use the configuration below to send events and log messages generated by the webhook activity to the `$RD_LOGS_DIR/rundeck.webhooks.log` file.

Default log4j configuration

```properties
log4j.logger.org.rundeck.webhook.events=INFO,webhook
log4j.additivity.org.rundeck.webhook.events=false

log4j.appender.webhook=org.apache.log4j.DailyRollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.webhook.file=${rundeck.log.dir}${file.separator}rundeck.webhook.log
log4j.appender.webhook.append=true
log4j.appender.webhook.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.webhook.layout.ConversionPattern=[%d{ISO8601}] %-5p %c{2} - %m%n
```
