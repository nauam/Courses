### Default Node Executor Configuration

When Rundeck executes a command on a node, it does so via a "Node Executor".
The most common built-in Node Executor is the "SSH" implementation, which uses
SSH to connect to the remote node, however other implementations can be used.

Select the Default Node Executor you wish to use for all remote Nodes for the project:

You can install more types of Node Executors as plugins, see [Node Execution Plugins](/manual/job-plugins.md#node-execution).

### Default File Copier Configuration

When Rundeck executes a script on a node, it does so by first copying the script as a file to the node, via a "File Copier". (It then uses a "Node Executor" to execute the script like a command.)

The most common built-in File Copier is the "SCP" implementation, which uses
SCP to copy the file to the remote node, however other implementations can be used.

Select the Default File Copier you wish to use for all remote Nodes for the project:

You can install more types of File Copiers as plugins, see [Node Execution Plugins](/manual/job-plugins.md#node-execution).


## Edit Nodes...
This section lets you add and modify Node Resource Model Sources for the project.
These sources contain the node definitions for the project.
A default source will be defined listing the Rundeck Host as a node as a result of the initial project creation.
You can configure additional Node Sources to gather all the node information relevant to this project.

See [Node Sources](/administration/projects/resource-model-sources/) for more details.

## Node Enhancers

Take advantage of the node enhancers that Rundeck offers by adding them to your nodes. See [Node Enhancers](/manual/node-enhancers.md) for more details.

## Access Control
Control access to the project with [ACL Policy GUI](/administration/security/acl-policy-editor.html) (Enterprise) or [Access Control Policy](/administration/security/authorization.html) files.

## Edit Readme...
A project ReadMe can provide some important context for a Project.  The content can be formatted using Markdown and can displayed on the Project's home page and as part of the Project Listing.

## Edit Message of the Day...
The Message of the Day is a way to communicate important messages to Project users.  The message can be dismissed or hidden after reading using the [x] in the upper right corner.
