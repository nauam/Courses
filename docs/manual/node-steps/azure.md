## Getting Started

:::tip
It is important to configure the azure resource model plugin before using these steps: [Azure Resource Model](https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/administration/projects/resource-model-sources/azure.html#azure-enterprise)
:::

The following properties are present for all node steps, and can be configured at the job, project or framework level.

**Client ID**
: The client ID for the application with access to the tenant to view VMs from.

- **Project setting**: project.azure.clientId
- **Framework Setting**: azure.clientId

**Tenant ID**
: The tenant (organization) in which the VMs live

- **Project setting**: project.azure.tenantId
- **Framework Setting**: azure.tenantId

**Subscription ID**
: The subscription ID for the appliaction with access to the tenant to view VMs from.

- **Project setting**: project.azure.subscriptionId
- **Framework Setting**: azure.subscriptionId

**Azure Access Key**
: The access key for the Azure application that contains access to the proper VMs.

- **Project setting**: project.azure.keyPath
- **Framework Setting**: azure.keyPath

:::danger
 Be very careful when using this step.  It would be possible to remove a lot of instances by mistake if the node filter is too broad.
