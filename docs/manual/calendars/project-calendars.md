# Project Calendars

You can also add calendars at project level. You will find a new menu on the project sidebar:

![Project Calendars](~@assets/img/calendars-project-home.png)

When you click **Add Calendar**, the form has the same structure as the [System Calendars](/manual/calendars/system-calendars.md), the only difference is the calendar will be applied for all Jobs in a Project or for a selected list of jobs within the Project.

Now you will see a new section called **Jobs** where you can define where the calendar will be used. By default, it will not be assigned to any jobs.


![Add a Job](~@assets/img/calendars-project-add-job-button.png)

Click "Add a Job..."

![Job Detail](~@assets/img/calendars-project-jobs-selector.png)

Click on a Job name.


![Job Selected](~@assets/img/calendars-project-jobs-selected.png)


Also, you can remove jobs from the list clicking "Remove".


You can also check the "Apply this Calendar to All Jobs" checkbox, to apply to all Jobs in the project:

![All Jobs](~@assets/img/calendars-project-jobs.png)


Save the Calendar.

Then, in the Jobs page you will see the list of calendars applied to the Job's schedule:
